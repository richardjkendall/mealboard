# Mealboard

This the source code of my Mealboard application.  A weekly planner to document the meals you plan to eat so you can know what food to buy.

The application is available free here: https://mealboard.richardjameskendall.com - anybody with a Google account can access it.

I wrote a blog article about here as well https://rjk.codes/post/meal-planning-application/
